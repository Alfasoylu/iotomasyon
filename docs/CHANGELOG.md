- Fixed Trendyol API base URL: migrated from deprecated `api.trendyol.com/sapigw/suppliers` to `apigw.trendyol.com/integration/order/sellers`
- Fixed `TrendyolReturn` interface to match live getClaims API: added `TrendyolClaimItem`, `TrendyolClaimItemStatus`, `TrendyolClaimItemReason`, `TrendyolClaimOrderLine`, `TrendyolClaimLineItem` interfaces; `items[]` replaces `lines[]`; `claimDate` replaces `createdDate`; status derived from `items[0].claimItems[0].claimItemStatus.name`

- Migration `20260517120000_phase28_private_note`: adds `privateNote TEXT` to `Product` table — nullable, additive, non-destructive; applied to production Supabase
- Created `lib/actions/product-actions.ts` → `updatePrivateNoteAction`: requires EXECUTIVE_READ + PRODUCTS_UPDATE; saves `product.privateNote` with `trim() || null`; revalidates edit + detail paths; intentionally separate from `updateProductAction` so non-owners cannot accidentally overwrite private intelligence
- Created `components/products/private-note-editor.tsx`: standalone client component using `useTransition`; amber-accented with `🔒 Sadece sahip görebilir` badge; textarea (5000 char limit with live counter); "Notu kaydet" button with pending/saved(3s)/error feedback

- Updated `lib/validations/product.ts`: `description` max raised from 2000 → 10000 (Tiptap HTML output regularly exceeds 2000 chars with formatted content)
- `normalizeProductData` in product-actions.ts explicitly omits `privateNote` with inline comment — XML import and normal product updates can never overwrite owner intelligence
- tsc --noEmit clean, Vercel deploy READY (commit ceac815)
- Browser-verified 2026-05-17: edit page loads after migration ✓; amber private note card visible with 🔒 badge ✓; note saved to DB via action ("Browser test notu: UV-82 için Çin'den ithalat planı — 2026-05-17 Phase 28 doğrulama.") confirmed via Supabase SQL ✓; detail page shows saved note under "🔒 Özel Not" ✓; "Tedarikçi Kaynağı" supplier card visible ✓

### Phase 29 — Order Ledger and Return Claims Sync (commit 3e615fd)
- Migration `20260517130000_phase29_return_records`: new `TrendyolReturnRecord` table — claimId, orderLineId (unique together), productId (nullable FK → Product SET NULL), orderNumber, orderDate, claimDate, status, reasonName, reasonCode, productName, barcode, merchantSku, unitPriceTry, syncedAt; 4 indexes; applied to production Supabase
- Created `lib/actions/returns-sync-actions.ts`: `syncTrendyolReturnsAction` — EXECUTIVE_READ-gated; sweeps 4 × 90-day windows (365 days total); barcode-first then SKU product matching; upserts TrendyolReturnRecord per (claimId, orderLineId); surfaces page-0 error to UI
- Created `components/orders/orders-sync-button.tsx`: combined sync client component — triggers both `syncTrendyolSalesAction` + `syncTrendyolReturnsAction` in parallel; reports orders and returns line counts + new record counts
- Created `app/(app)/orders/page.tsx`: local order ledger page — 5 tabs (Tümü/Teslim Edildi/İptal Beklemede/İadeler/Eşleşmemiş) with live counts; 100-row pages sorted newest-first; product column links matched rows, shows "Eşleşmemiş" amber badge for unmatched; unmatched tab shows amber hint with link to /admin/marketplace-mappings; İadeler tab renders TrendyolReturnRecord rows with reason column; pagination links
- Updated `app/(app)/layout.tsx`: added "Siparişler" nav item (EXECUTIVE_READ) before "Satış Performansı"
- Updated `components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`: info card updated to "Faz 29 aktif"
- tsc --noEmit clean, Vercel deploy READY (commit 3e615fd)
- Browser-verified 2026-05-17: /orders loads (1.105 sipariş, sayfa 1/12) ✓; "Siparişler" sidebar link active ✓; all 5 tabs render with correct counts ✓; matched product row links to /products/[id] ✓; unmatched rows show amber "Eşleşmemiş" badge ✓; Eşleşmemiş tab amber hint + Ürün Eşleştirme link ✓; İadeler tab shows correct empty state (no returns synced yet) ✓; Teslim Edildi count 952 ✓

### Phase 25–28 Closure Fixes (commit 4bf6bd4)

**Issue 1 — Owner-only privateNote gating (stricter than Phase 28 original)**
- Changed `updatePrivateNoteAction` gate from `checkPermission(EXECUTIVE_READ)` to `isOwner(user)` — only the ADMIN_EMAIL account can write private notes; other ADMIN-role users are excluded
- Added `isOwner()` helper to `lib/auth.ts`: `user.email.toLowerCase() === getAdminEmail().toLowerCase()`
- Updated `app/(app)/products/[id]/page.tsx` and `edit/page.tsx`: `canViewPrivate` now uses `Promise.resolve(isOwner(user))` (was `checkPermission(EXECUTIVE_READ)`)
- Text correction: "Sadece yetkili kullanıcılar görebilir" → "Sadece sahip görebilir" (accurately reflects isOwner semantics)

**Issue 2 — Performance-based sorts on /products**
- Added 3 new sort options to `components/products/product-filters.tsx`: `sales_30d_qty` (30G Satış Adedi ↓), `sales_30d_rev` (30G Ciro ↓), `sales_all_rev` (Toplam Ciro ↓)
- Added `SALES_SORTS` set and in-memory aggregation block to `services/product-service.ts`: fetches `TrendyolSalesRecord` for visible products only, excludes cancelled orders ("iptal"/"cancel"), aggregates qty30d/rev30d/revAll per productId, sorts in JS
- Total sort options: 10 (was 7)

**Issue 3 — Rich-text description rendering on detail page**
- `app/(app)/products/[id]/page.tsx`: added `trimStart().startsWith("<")` heuristic to detect Tiptap HTML output; renders via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with Tailwind 4 arbitrary-variant prose styles (`[&_h2]:`, `[&_ul]:`, `[&_strong]:`, etc.) — no `@tailwindcss/typography` dependency needed
- Plain-text descriptions continue to render as before

**Issue 4 — XML overwrite policy documentation**
- Added explicit `// XML Overwrite Policy` comment block to `lib/actions/xml-sync-actions.ts` documenting SOURCE-MANAGED (stock, imageUrl fallback-fill), CURATED (name/brand/description/prices/privateNote — never overwritten), XML-ONLY STORAGE (XmlProductData), and NEW-product bootstrap behaviour
- Added inline comments at the existing-product update step

- tsc --noEmit clean, ESLint clean, Vercel deploy READY (commit 4bf6bd4)
- Browser-verified 2026-05-17: /products loads (651 ürün) ✓; all 10 sort options render ✓; sales_30d_qty sort changes product order (no crash) ✓; HTML description renders H2/bold/bullet-list on BAOFENG UV-82 detail page ✓; owner private note visible with "Sadece sahip görebilir" text ✓; edit page loads correctly ✓

### Phase 27 — Product Media and Content Studio
- Installed Tiptap (`@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`, `@tiptap/extension-link`) for rich text description authoring
- Created `components/products/rich-text-editor.tsx`: Tiptap-based WYSIWYG editor; SSR-safe with `mounted` guard (renders placeholder before hydration); toolbar with H2, H3, Bold, Italic, Bullet list, Ordered list; outputs HTML to react-hook-form via `onChange`; syncs external value changes (e.g. "XML'den al") via `lastPushedValue` ref to prevent infinite update loops
- Created `lib/actions/product-image-actions.ts`: `addProductImageByUrlAction` (URL validation, sortOrder = existing count), `deleteProductImageAction` (compact sortOrders after delete), `setPrimaryImageAction` (moves target to sortOrder 0, shifts others), `uploadProductImageAction` (Supabase Storage REST API — no SDK; validates MIME type and 5 MB limit; creates ProductImage row)
- Created `components/products/product-image-manager.tsx`: client component — multi-image grid sorted by sortOrder; "Birincil" ring on primary image; source badges (MANUEL emerald / XML blue); URL input with Enter-to-add and "Ekle" button (input clears on success); optimistic UI updates; file upload via `<input type="file">` forwarded to upload action; `canUpload` boolean prop controls whether upload UI or amber config-missing notice renders
- Updated `components/products/product-form.tsx`: description `<Textarea>` replaced with `<RichTextEditor>` (controlled via `form.watch` + `form.setValue`); `imageUrl` field label updated to "Görsel URL (birincil)" with hint about Medya Stüdyosu; optional `xmlDescription` prop — renders blue card with XML source text (line-clamp-4) and "Editöre taşı" button that calls `form.setValue("description", xmlDescription)`
- Updated `app/(app)/products/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: added `ProductImageManager` card (Faz 27 — Medya Stüdyosu) between main form and supplier card; `xmlDescription` wired from `product.xmlData?.xmlDescription`; `canUpload` evaluated server-side (`!!(process.env.SUPABASE_URL && process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)`)
- Updated `.env.example`: added `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with instructions for creating `product-images` public bucket in Supabase Storage
- XML sync governance: existing `xml-sync-actions.ts` already never overwrites `Product.description` on existing products — no code change needed
- No new DB schema — uses existing `ProductImage` model (Phase 11A)
- tsc --noEmit clean, Vercel deploy READY (commit ab1a8ef)

- Applied migration `20260517160000_phase32_import_governance` to production Supabase
- Exported `effectiveFreightPerKg()` helper from `lib/import-decision.ts`: product override → supplier default → global constant (AIR=8, SEA=1 USD/kg)

  - Shipping resolution: product/platform policy override > price-tier default
  - `priceSourceLabel/priceSourceColor`, `shippingSourceLabel` badge helpers
- Updated product detail `app/(app)/products/[id]/page.tsx`: "Pazar Yeri Fiyatlandırması" card using canonical engine
  - 5 platforms: Trendyol, Hepsiburada, Amazon, Pazarama, Idefix
  - Per-row: XML Fiyat | Etkin Fiyat | Kaynak badge | Kargo ₺ + source badge | Komisyon % + source badge | Net Kalan ₺ | Net Marj %
